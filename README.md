# FOSSEE Workshops - UI/UX Enhancement

A mobile-first redesign of the FOSSEE Workshops Django web app, rebuilt as a modern React + Tailwind CSS frontend.

## Setup Instructions
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Design Principles

- **Mobile-first**: Every page was built for small screens first, then scaled up. As it was mentioned the website is primarily accessed on phones.
- **Visual hierarchy**: Clear headings, muted secondary text, and consistent spacing guide the eye naturally.
- **FOSSEE brand colors**: Used the official orange `#e85d04` from fossee.in for buttons, active states, and accents.
- **Minimal clutter**: Replaced Bootstrap's heavy table-heavy layouts with clean cards, clean tables, and whitespace.
- **Accessible**: Semantic HTML, proper labels on inputs, aria-label on icon buttons.

## Responsiveness

- Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`md:`, `sm:`) used throughout, navbar collapses to hamburger on mobile, grids stack to single column.
- Tested on iPhone 12 Pro (390px) using Chrome DevTools.
- `overflow-x-auto` on all tables so they scroll horizontally on small screens instead of breaking layout.
- Fixed navbar with `pt-14` on main content so nothing hides behind it on any screen size.

## Trade-offs

| Decision | Trade-off |
|---|---|
| Hardcoded placeholder data | Real API integration left for later, kept frontend concerns separate |
| No animations | Kept load times fast, no unnecessary JS |
| Tailwind over CSS modules | Faster to build, classes can get verbose but readable |
| React Router for navigation | Adds a dependency but gives clean client-side routing |

## Challenges

**Biggest challenge**: Getting Tailwind v3 working with Vite from scratch. The `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` was empty by default, so no styles were generating. Solved by pointing it to `./src/**/*.{js,jsx}`.

**Second challenge**: Rebuilding the Django template's dynamic data (user auth, workshop lists, comments) as static React state, had to think carefully about component structure so it's easy to wire up to a real API later.

**Approach**: I rebuilt the legacy Django UI into modular React components with a strict mobile-first mindset. Since the web is mostly used on mobile, I prioritized responsive card layouts over heavy tables, using Tailwind to ensure the site is snappy, accessible, and aligned with FOSSEE’s official branding.
